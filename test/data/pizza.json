The wait to get seated was not long, after that everything else went downhill fast. It took forever for our order to come. The waitress did apologize several times, but when we mentioned it to the manager we got nothing but a evil look and he pretty much blew us off. When the food finally arrived we were treated to mediocre pizza at best. Poor attitudes and poor food means we wont be going back to Adriennes Pizza Bar."},"Distance":"0.15","Url":"https://local.yahoo.com/info-30548758-adrienne-s-pizzabar-new-york","ClickUrl":"https://local.yahoo.com/info-30548758-adrienne-s-pizzabar-new-york","MapUrl":"https://local.yahoo.com/info-30548758-adrienne-s-pizzabar-new-york?viewtype=map","BusinessUrl":"http://www.adriennespizzabarnyc.com/","BusinessClickUrl":"http://www.adriennespizzabarnyc.com/","Categories":{"Category":[{"id":"96926243","content":"Pizza"},{"id":"96926057","content":"Bar & Pub"},{"id":"96926236","content":"Restaurant"},{"id":"96926184","content":"Tapas Restaurant"},{"id":"96926190","content":"Italian Restaurant"},{"id":"96930673","content":"Food Wholesaler"}]}},{"id":"11307718","xmlns":"urn:yahoo:lcl","Title":"Grimaldi's","Address":"1 Front St","City":"Brooklyn","State":"NY","Phone":"(718) 858-4300","Latitude":"40.702565","Longitude":"-73.993317","Rating":{"AverageRating":"4","TotalRatings":"61","TotalReviews":"61","LastReviewDate":"1354817098","LastReviewIntro":" The wait is atrocious (Took us over an hour on both occasions), but if you are a fan of good, thin-crust pizza, then this place is for you. A little on the pricey side if you like your pizza covered in toppings, but if you re getting one or two it won t break the bank. The pizza we got the last time had sun-dried tomatoes on it, and that was enough for us. Very tasty."},"Distance":"0.94","Url":"https://local.yahoo.com/info-11307718-grimaldi-s-brooklyn","ClickUrl":"https://local.yahoo.com/info-11307718-grimaldi-s-brooklyn","MapUrl":"https://local.yahoo.com/info-11307718-grimaldi-s-brooklyn?viewtype=map","BusinessUrl":"http://www.grimaldis.com/","BusinessClickUrl":"http://www.grimaldis.com/","Categories":{"Category":[{"id":"96926243","content":"Pizza"},{"id":"96926236","content":"Restaurant"}]}},{"id":"11040019","xmlns":"urn:yahoo:lcl","Title":"Underground Pizza","Address":"2 William St","City":"New York","State":"NY","Phone":"(212) 425-4442","Latitude":"40.704988","Longitude":"-74.009674","Rating":{"AverageRating":"5","TotalRatings":"1","TotalReviews":"1","LastReviewDate":"1322831335","LastReviewIntro":" I really liked the service.
